  — Hello, i am a <b><a href="http://t.me/ScamMamontaNetBot">@SCAM-MAMONTA.NET</a></b> Bot 🦣

  — I am a simple bot that will warn your channel subscribers that the built-in advertising from the telegram does not apply to your community and the owners of this advertising may not be conscientious people.

  — In order for me to work for you, you just need to add me to your telegram channel and grant administrator rights, with the following capabilities: 

  <b>DELETE</b> 🗑

  <b>POST</b> ✏️

  <b>EDIT</> ✍️  

  — Do not worry, all your posts will remain safe and sound. <b>I</b> will only send automatic warnings at the very end of your telegram channel, before the advertising section. If you do not believe, then it does not matter, the bot is open source. 

  — <b>Commands:</b>

  <b>/set_language</b> — change language for your channel

  <b>/language</b> — set language

  <b>/github</b> — watch open source
